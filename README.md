## About

A game where the player tries to rotate hexagonal tiles in order to create certain patterns. The game already exists, designed by Alexey Pajitnov who is also known as the creator of Tetris.

## Requirements

- The core mechanic: Select a hexagonal group of three and turn them clockwise or counterclockwise. If 3 hexagons of the same color match, they should explode. Otherwise, the hexagons should return back to their initial states.
- The game grid should be changeable from the editor easily. The default grid is 8x9.
- Colors and color count of the hexagons should also be changeable from the editor easily. By default, there are 5 colors.
- Scoring is 5 times the exploded hexagon count.
- A bomb hexagon should appear on every 1000 score. The bombâ€™s function is to count from a number every time an action is made on the board. When the number reaches zero, the bomb explodes and the game is lost.
- The game is over when there are no more available moves left or the bomb explodes.
